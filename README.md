# OCR-System-Homework-
This assignment is supposed to be a tutorial assignment that will lead you step by step to use Python 3 and built-in functions from several Python libraries to build an optical character recognition (OCR) system for hand-written characters, as a practice on binary image analysis.

About RunMyOCR.py
Following the instruction, while setting classes from mydict, it always fail and says KeyError: 
‘classes’, since the test_gt_py3.pkl is given and I do not know whether should I modify it. I 
didn’t use the way to test accuracy, I just count how many characters has been recognized 
and store it to the dictionary ‘outputlist’ in the test.py. About reading images, the train will 
automatically detect all images in the give path ‘path1’ in train.py, and extract its features for 
test.py use.
